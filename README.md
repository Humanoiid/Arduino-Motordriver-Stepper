# **Arduino-Motordriver-Stepper**

Arduino + Stepper motor to control small Stepper motor with high angular resolution/ low speed

### **Caution**

- Some of codes comments are worng, as they are remnant of the things that were being modified.
- Sources list order: create time

## **Source list**

(different folder by motor)

1. ARDUINO_STEPPER_Direct.ino
    - Directly control Stepper motor by Arduino
    - Show the vibration and some unstable rotation
2. ARDUINO_DRV8833_Stepper.ino
    - Using Motor driver(DRV8833 for 2 DC motor or Stepper)
    - Can control Stepper with Full step
3. ARDUINO_STSPIN220_Stepper.ino
    - Using Motor driver(STSPIN220 for microstepping with low voltage)
    - can control motor with smooth rotation
    - motor shows strong heat - it seems need to check current or power
4. ARDUINO_STSPIN220_Stepper_manual.ino
    - manually control the time for rotation speed control
5. *_Trigger.ino
    - use 1 DIO pin for trigger
6. *_AccelStepper.ino
    - external library. not well implemented
